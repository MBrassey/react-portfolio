            My workflow when creating a decentralized application begins with
            writing & deploying a solidity smart contract to a local blockchain
            using truffle & ganache.

              alt="Truffle Commands"
              className="image"
            />
            I unit test the contract using assertions in Javascript or the Jest
            framework. Next, I model & wire the backend using Express, frontend
            with React & Web3. I deploy the contract to an Ethereum testnet such
            as Kovan, Ropsten or Rinkeby using the Remix IDE.

              alt="Remix IDE"
              className="image"
            />
            Finally, I deploy the smartcontract(s) to Ethereum Mainnet & webapp
            assets to the InterPlanetary Filesystem (IPFS). I have experience in
            registering mainnet contract sourcecode, abi's and contract profiles
            including token / contract logos to Etherscan.

            Below is my ERC-20 Token, Token Wallet & Exchange, waviii.io. I
            deployed waviii-token to Ethereum Mainnet, it has a real value and
            you can exchange ETH and waviii back and forth. The total supply is
            1 million tokens, most of which reside on my token exchange contract
            listening for trades at any time. I used web3 to provide MetaMask or
            access to the token and exchange smartcontracts.
